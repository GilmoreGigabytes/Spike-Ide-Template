# What this repositorys for

This code will work on the Spike Prime Ide, so it has no new python features such as match statements, os module, printf (which has been around for years) and so on. 

If you get any errors unrelated to Spike Prime or your changes feel, free to submit an issue and we will do our best to fix it.
